# üìö Online Book Review App
This project is the final assignment for the Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express course on Coursera, which is part of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate. In this project, I have built a server-side online book review application, integrated it with a secure REST API using JWT based session level authentication, and tested the built application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.

***
## üè° Features

Register and log in with a username and password

Secure authentication using JWT and session management

Browse a list of books with information including ISBN, title, author, and review

Search for books by ISBN, author, or title

Add, update, or delete a review (only for authenticated users)

Reviews are tied to the user who posted them

## üöÄ Technologies Used
Node.js - A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling fast and scalable network applications. 

Express - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. 

Axios - A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to APIs, supporting async calls and working well with async/await for handling asynchronous operations. 

JWT (jsonwebtoken) - A compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, commonly used for authentication.
